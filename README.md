# VulnHub Write-ups

This repository contains methodology-focused write-ups of intentionally vulnerable VulnHub virtual machines.

The purpose of these write-ups is to practice and document offensive security techniques in **authorized lab environments**, with an emphasis on:
- Reconnaissance and attack surface analysis  
- Hypothesis-driven testing and validation  
- Exploitability reasoning and decision-making  
- Responsible impact demonstration  
- Reflection and lessons learned  

Rather than providing exploit dumps or step-by-step attack scripts, the focus is on **how and why vulnerabilities occur**, how they can be reasoned about as an attacker, and what signals confirm or invalidate an attack path.

## Scope & Ethics

- All targets are deliberately vulnerable VMs designed for learning and practice  
- No live systems, real-world targets, or unauthorized testing  
- Techniques are discussed for educational purposes only  
- Content is written with restraint to avoid enabling misuse  

## Structure

Each virtual machine has its own directory containing a single write-up, typically structured around:
- Initial recon and observations  
- Hypotheses formed and tested  
- Validation outcomes  
- Exploitability and impact reasoning  
- Mistakes, biases, and key takeaways  

This repository reflects ongoing skill development and disciplined offensive security practice.
